each level have corsponding led, tankFloating_sen_1, tankSensorValue1_1 

instead of declaring these manuel
then create a array foreach of them and then the first value is 0 then
add them in as first sensor = first led = floation, and have function for adding them.

then change method to go though array instead of  setLedStatus(bool led_1, bool led_2, bool led_3, bool led_4, bool led_5)

when they need declaring then

next step let this be done from fron end by having a file spiffs to read from and setting to 
so then same for relay pin declaring,
